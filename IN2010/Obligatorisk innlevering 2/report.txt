1. 
In this project, I have had a time complexity of O(|V| + |E|) time for my DFS solution, since it goes through all the nodes and edges.
As for the rest, the time complexity is O(n^2) since I haven't exceeded double for-loops.

2. 
We require that there are no cycles in the project. 
If we do detect a cycle, then the project will not start.
We also require a directed graph for this project.

3. 
For this implementation, I have used depth-first search.
